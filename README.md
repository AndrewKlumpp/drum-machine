# drum-machine
This project uses HTML, CSS and JS to build a simple drum machine.

The tutorial can be found here: https://medium.com/@iminked/build-a-drum-machine-with-javascript-html-and-css-33a53eeb1f73

This will teach me about audio files and event listening in JS along with continued learning about styling with CSS.
